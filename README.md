We have two sample sinatra projects here:
- /front => is a simple html render, it runs on port 3000
- /back  => a simple backend that returns json for URI requests, it runs on port 8080

Executing:
```
./bin run.sh # starts both servers
./bin hasta_la_vista.sh # it is a monster and heartless script that kills every unicorn you have running
```
